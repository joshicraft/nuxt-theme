# Source Template Documents

**Thank you for purchasing my template.**

If you have any questions that are beyond the scope of this help file, 
Please feel free to email via my user page contact form <http://themeforest.net/user/themebiotic#contact>.

*Thank you.*

[TOC]

**Source** is a clean and modern Multi-Purpose **VueJS** &amp; **Nuxt**, HTML5 &amp; CSS3  **Bulma** template. You can create universal apps without the hassle with Nuxt. Also you can statically render your VueJS apps and get all of benefits of a universal app without a server with the same code line. This is entirely up to you!

We created the Source demo page on the json-server to give you an idea. You can easily define a data source you want with axios and enrich your pages with dynamic content. Here you can take a look at our fake-api data http://fake-api.source.themebiotic.com

## Nuxt Config

The `nuxt.config.js` file contains your Nuxt.js custom configuration. *This file can not be renamed.*

By default, Nuxt.js is configured to cover most use cases. This default configuration can be overwritten by modifying the `nuxt.config.js` file. The **Source** template comes with its own settings, and you may want to change these settings. Some information, such as the *meta information* of the page, is in this ``nuxt.config.js``  file.

##### Let's take a look at this meta information in the following example.

```javascript
head: {
    title: 'Source',
    meta: [
      { charset: 'utf-8' },
      { name: 'viewport', content: 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1' },
      { hid: 'description', name: 'description', content: 'Source vuejs project' }
    ],
    link: [
      { rel: 'icon', type: 'image/x-icon', href: '/favicon.ico' },
      { rel: "stylesheet", href: '//cdn.materialdesignicons.com/2.2.43/css/materialdesignicons.min.css' }
    ]
  },
```

The meta information you see is pre-defined information for each page. You can update this to your own web site.

There is another important setting in the ``nuxt.config.js`` file, this is the default **baseURL** setting for axios. This setting allows you to specify that you want to receive dynamic content. So you can use these dynamic content in the pages. You would see the **baseURL** in the following example.

```javascript
axios: {
	"baseURL": "http://fake-api.source.themebiotic.com"
},
```

If you do not want to take dynamic content with axios, you can delete this setting.

If you need more information about nuxt configuration, you can review the nuxt documentations on https://nuxtjs.org/guide/configuration



## What is Nuxt.js ?

Nuxt.js is a framework for creating Universal Vue.js Applications.

Its main scope is **UI rendering** while abstracting away the client/server distribution.

Our goal is to create a framework flexible enough that you can use it as a main project base or in addition to your current project **based on Node.js.**

Nuxt.js presets all the configuration needed to make your development of a Vue.js Application **Server Rendered** more enjoyable.

In addition, we also provide another deployment option called: *nuxt generate*. It will build a **Static Generated** Vue.js Application. We believe that option could be the next big step in the development of Web Applications with microservices.

As a framework, Nuxt.js comes with a lot of features to help you in your development between the client side and the server side such as Asynchronous Data, Middleware, Layouts, etc.



## Installation of the Source

The **Source** works with Nuxtjs and Nuxt needs nodejs to work. So I assume NodeJS is installed on your system. if not, you must first install **NodeJs**. Check [this page](https://nodejs.org) for documentation on Nodejs.

Since everything is okay, we can start by installing the necessary packages. First, take a look at the **source** folder. Here you will see a **package.json** file. This file holds all the necessary packages we need. Install the dependencies with the following command.

```bash
npm install
```

After a while all the necessary packages will be loaded, Now we can start our nuxt project with the following command.

```bash
npm run dev
```

If everything goes well, you will see output like this:

```bash
npm run dev

> source@0.1.0 dev /CreativeMarket/source
> HOST=0.0.0.0 nuxt

… debug nuxt › axios › baseURL: http://fake-api.source.themebiotic.com
… debug nuxt › axios › browserBaseURL: http://fake-api.source.themebiotic.com
  nuxt:build App root: /CreativeMarket/source +0ms
  nuxt:build Generating /CreativeMarket/source/.nuxt files... +1ms
  nuxt:build Generating files... +66ms
  nuxt:build Generating routes... +10ms
  nuxt:build Building files... +28ms
  nuxt:build Adding webpack middleware... +183ms
  ████████████████████ 100%
Build completed in 12.586s

DONE  Compiled successfully in 1590ms                                                                        1:09:13 AM

OPEN  http://localhost:3000
```

Now you can access the page http://localhost:3000 from your browser. Everything is okay now you can start to develop.



## Nuxt Directory Structure

The default Nuxt.js application structure is intended to provide a great starting point for both small and large applications. Of course, you are free to organize your application however you like.

| Folder     | **Description**                                              |
| :--------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| assets     | The `assets` directory contains your un-compiled assets such as Less, Sass or JavaScript. |
| components | The `components` directory contains your Vue.js Components. Nuxt.js doesn't supercharge the data method on these components. |
| layouts    | The `layouts` directory contains your Application Layouts. *This directory cannot be renamed.* |
| middleware | The `middleware` directory contains your Application Middleware. Middleware lets you define custom functions that can be run before rendering either a page or a group of pages (layouts). |
| pages      | The `pages` directory contains your Application Views and Routes. The framework reads all the `.vue` files inside this directory and creates the application router.  *This directory cannot be renamed.* |
| plugins    | The `plugins` directory contains your Javascript plugins that you want to run before instantiating the root Vue.js Application. |
| static     | The `static` directory contains your static files. Each file inside this directory is mapped to `/`. **Example:** `/static/robots.txt` is mapped as `/robots.txt` *This directory cannot be renamed.* |
| store      | The `store` directory contains your [Vuex Store](http://vuex.vuejs.org/en/) files. The Vuex Store option is implemented in the Nuxt.js framework. Creating an `index.js` file in this directory enables the option in the framework automatically. |
