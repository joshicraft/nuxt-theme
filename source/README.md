# Source

**Source** is a clean and modern Multi-Purpose **VueJS** &amp; **Nuxt**, HTML5 &amp; CSS3  **Bulma** template. You can create universal apps without the hassle with Nuxt. Also you can statically render your VueJS apps and get all of benefits of a universal app without a server with the same code line. This is entirely up to you!

We created the Source demo page on the json-server to give you an idea. You can easily define a data source you want with axios and enrich your pages with dynamic content. Here you can take a look at our fake-api data http://fake-api.source.themebiotic.com
